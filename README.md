The objective of this repository is to simplify the process of printing things to a thermal printer via the [ESC/POS protocol](https://download4.epson.biz/sec_pubs/pos/reference_en/escpos/index.html).

In particular, it is targetted for use with the [vretti 58mm thermal receipt printer](https://a.co/d/3cw1X8n), as that is what I have with me.
